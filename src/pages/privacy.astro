          Your privacy is important to us. This application does not collect any
          private information from users. However, to enhance user experience,
          we utilize third-party analytical tools that gather anonymous data
          about app usage, such as the number of visits, time spent on the
          application, button clicks, and similar metrics. Additionally, by
          clicking on certain buttons or elements within the application, users
          may be presented with available navigation applications (the
          application reads from the device which navigation applications are
          installed). It is important to note that this application does not
          collect or share your private data in these interactions. This
          application does not require login or creation of a user account and
          is open for use to everyone regardless of age. We use Firebase
          Crashlytics and Firebase Performance as third-party tools to monitor
          the stability of the application and improve performance by collecting
          crash data. This tool gathers information such as device state at the
          time of the crash, device type, operating system version, and similar
          metadata. All technical data is encrypted.

          <strong>Important:</strong> We act solely as an intermediary booking platform. Your personal information is shared with 
          the licensed third-party service provider you choose to book with. Once we forward your details to the service provider, 
          they become responsible for handling your personal data according to their own privacy practices. We do not provide 
          any recreational services directly.
